### Accessibility
- `role` attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The `role` attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.

- Every `region` role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the `aria-labelledby` attribute.

- Typeface plays an important role in the accessibility of a page. Some fonts are easier to read than others, and this is especially true on low-resolution screens.
